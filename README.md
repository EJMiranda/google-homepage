From The Odin Project's [curriculum]
(http://www.theodinproject.com/ courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Project Name: 
Google Homepage

Objective: 
Replicate Google's main landing page and a page with search results.

Skills: 
HTML & CSS.

Description:
Introductory assignment for evaluating basic knowledge of HTML and CSS:
- Separation of concerns.
- Structure with <div> and <span>.
- Layout (Position, Display, Float and Clear).
- Horizontal menus.
- Mouse events.
- Classes and ID.

Additional notes:
- Code style and formatting mainly from Google's guidelines, for reference.
- Elements outside of the scope of the curriculum were added with <img>.

Personal takeaway:
- Take a few hours to properly understand these properties:
  - Position
  - Display
  - Float/Clear
- When changing values of properties, understand why each result is obtained.
- When creating the structure, create a layout mockup with background-color.
- Make use of git during practice to familiarize with the process.
